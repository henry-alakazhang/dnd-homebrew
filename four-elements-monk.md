# Way of the Four Elements
Homebrew modifications for Way of the Four Elements Monk

Vou follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to harness the elements. When you focus your ki, you can align yourself with the forces of creation and bend the four elements to your will, using them as an extension of your body. Most members of this tradition dedicate themselves to a single element, but some are capable of weaving the elements together.

Many monks of this tradition tattoo their bodies with representations of their ki powers, commonly imagined as coiling dragons, but also as phoenixes, fish. plants, mountains and cresting waves.

## The Four Elements
When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, and additionally at 6th, 11th and 17th level, you learn how to manipulate the elements in subtle ways. You choose one of the following elements: Earth, Water, Fire, Air. You gain the ability to control and reshape those elements that would fit in 5ft cube - the equivalent of an elemental cantrip such as Mold Earth or Shape Water. This elemental manipulation cannot be used to trap or injure other creatures.

At 6th level, you may spend 1 ki point to double the width (to a 10ft cube) of the manipulation. At 11th level, you may spend an additional point to double it again to a 20ft cube, and again at 17th level, spending up to 3 ki points to manipulate a 40ft cube.
