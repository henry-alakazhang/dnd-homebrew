# Roguish Archetype - Outlaw
You focus your combat techniques on ranged prowess and battlefield control. While some fighters stay in the melee and others snipe from afar, you prefer to abuse what your opponents lack, diving into close combat with rangers but keeping melee fighters at a shot's length. This archetype includes bandits and many pirates.
Outlaws deal best with chaotic battlefields with a multitude of allies and opponents.
