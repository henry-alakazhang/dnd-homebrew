### Inspiring Word
Starting at 3rd level, when you use your Second Wind, you may choose an additional creature within 30 ft that can hear you. That creature regains the same hit points you do. You can target further creatures at 10th level and 18th level

### Force of Personality
Starting at 7th level, you may add Strength modifier to your Charisma saving throws instead of your Charisma modifier.

### Enduring Cry
Starting at 10th level, whenever a creature is healed by your Second Wind, they gain advantage on the next saving throw they make before your next turn.

### Undeniable
Starting at 15th level, when you use your Action Surge, if you have no uses of Second Wind remaining, you regain a use of Second Wind.

### Unstoppable
Starting at 18th level, creatures targetted by your Second Wind may gain temporary hit points instead of regaining hit points.
